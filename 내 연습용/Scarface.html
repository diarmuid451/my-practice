     <pre>
      Push it to the limit
      Walk along the razor's edge
      But don't look down, just keep your head
      Or you'll be finished
      
      Open up the limit 
      Past the point of no return 
      You've reached the top but still you gotta learn
      How to keep it 
      
      Hit the wheel and double the stakes
      Throttle wide open like a bat out of hell
      You crash the gates <em>(Crash the gates)</em>
      Going for the back of beyond
      Nothing gonna stop you, there's nothing that strong
      So close now you're nearly at the brink
      So, push it, ooh yeah

      Welcome to the limit <em>(Limit)</em>
      Take it baby one step more
      The power game's still playing so
      You better win it
      
      Push it to the limit <em>(Limit)</em>
      No one left to stand in your way
      You might get careless, but you'll never be safe
      While you're still in it

      Welcome to the limit <em>(Limit)</em>
      Standing on the razor's edge
      Don't look down just keep your head
      Or you'll be finished

      Welcome to the limit
      Push it to the limit
